# Quick Test - 3D Preview Feature

**Version**: 2.2.0
**Date**: 2025-10-05

---

## Quick Verification

The 3D preview feature is now fully installed and ready to use!

### Step 1: Verify matplotlib is installed

```bash
python -c "import matplotlib; print(f'matplotlib version: {matplotlib.__version__}')"
```

**Expected output**:
```
matplotlib version: 3.10.5
```

✅ If you see the version number, matplotlib is installed correctly!

### Step 2: Run automated test

```bash
python test_3d_preview.py
```

**Expected output**:
```
============================================================
Testing 3D Preview Functionality
============================================================

1. Creating test heightmap (4096x4096)...
   [PASS] Test heightmap created: (4096, 4096)

2. Initializing Preview3D...
   [PASS] Preview3D initialized

3. Testing downsampling performance...
   [PASS] Downsampled from (4096, 4096) to (256, 256)
   [PASS] Downsample time: 0.0020s

4. Testing 3D preview generation...
   [PASS] 3D preview generated successfully
   [PASS] Generation time: 0.1703s
   [OK] EXCELLENT: Generation is fast (<1s)

...

============================================================
ALL TESTS PASSED!
============================================================
```

✅ If all tests pass, 3D preview is working!

### Step 3: Test in GUI

```bash
python gui_main.py
```

**Steps**:
1. Click **"Generate Playable"** button
   - Wait for terrain to generate (~1s)
   - Preview shows hillshade

2. Click **"3D Preview"** button (in Quick Actions)
   - Status bar: "Generating 3D preview..."
   - Wait ~0.2s

3. **3D window should open!**
   - Shows terrain as 3D surface
   - Colored by elevation (blue→green→brown→white)
   - Info dialog explains controls

4. **Test mouse controls**:
   - **Left-click + drag**: Rotate view
   - **Right-click + drag**: Pan view
   - **Scroll wheel**: Zoom in/out

5. **Close 3D window** when done
   - Click X to close
   - Main GUI stays open

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No module named 'matplotlib'"

**Solution**: Install matplotlib
```bash
pip install matplotlib>=3.5.0
```

### Issue: 3D window opens but is blank

**Possible causes**:
1. **Terrain not generated yet**
   - Click "Generate Playable" first
   - Wait for generation to complete

2. **Matplotlib backend issue**
   - Try different backend:
   ```python
   import matplotlib
   matplotlib.use('TkAgg')  # or 'Qt5Agg'
   ```

### Issue: 3D window is slow or laggy

**Solution**: Lower resolution (in src/preview_3d.py)
```python
# Change from 256 to 128
preview = Preview3D(resolution=128)
```

This will be 4× faster but slightly less detailed.

### Issue: Colors look wrong

This is **normal**! The colors represent elevation:
- **Blue**: Low elevation (valleys, water level)
- **Green**: Mid elevation (plains, foothills)
- **Brown**: High elevation (mountains)
- **White**: Peak elevation (summits)

The terrain also has **2× vertical exaggeration** to make features more visible.

## What You Should See

### Successful 3D Preview

When working correctly, you should see:

1. **Status bar feedback**:
   - "Generating 3D preview..." (brief)
   - "3D preview generated - Use mouse to rotate and zoom"

2. **Info dialog** (first time):
   ```
   3D Preview Generated!

   Mouse Controls:
   • Left-click + drag: Rotate view
   • Right-click + drag: Pan view
   • Scroll wheel: Zoom in/out

   Tips:
   • Terrain has 2× vertical exaggeration for better visibility
   • Colors show elevation (blue=low, green=mid, brown=high, white=peaks)
   • Close window when done to free resources

   Note: 3D preview shows downsampled terrain (256×256) for performance.
   ```

3. **3D window**:
   - Title: "3D Heightmap Preview"
   - Terrain surface with elevation colors
   - Axis labels (X, Y, Elevation)
   - Colorbar on right side
   - Smooth rotation when dragging

---

## Performance Metrics

On a typical system, you should see:

| Metric | Expected Value |
|--------|----------------|
| Generation time | ~0.17s |
| Rotation FPS | 60fps (smooth) |
| Memory usage | ~50MB |
| GUI freeze | None (non-blocking) |

If your times are much slower, try lowering the resolution (see troubleshooting above).

## Next Steps

Once 3D preview is working:

1. **Try different terrain types**
   - Generate "Mountains" preset
   - Generate "Islands" preset
   - Compare in 3D!

2. **Edit terrain, then preview**
   - Use brush tools to modify terrain
   - Click 3D Preview to see changes
   - Iterate until satisfied

3. **Open multiple previews**
   - Generate terrain A
   - Click 3D Preview (Window 1)
   - Generate terrain B
   - Click 3D Preview (Window 2)
   - Compare side-by-side!

---

## Summary

✅ **matplotlib installed** (v3.10.5)
✅ **Tests passing** (0.17s generation time)
✅ **GUI integrated** (3D Preview button in Quick Actions)
✅ **Performance excellent** (256× downsampling, 60fps rotation)

**The 3D preview feature is ready to use!**

Try it now:
```bash
python gui_main.py
```

Then click "Generate Playable" followed by "3D Preview" and enjoy your interactive 3D terrain visualization!
