# Task 2.2 Completion Summary - Binary Buildability Mask

**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Module**: src/buildability_enforcer.py (method: `generate_buildability_mask_from_tectonics`)
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE & TESTED

---

## Implementation

**Method**: `BuildabilityEnforcer.generate_buildability_mask_from_tectonics()`

**Key Features**:
- Generates **BINARY** mask (0 or 1, NOT gradient 0.0-1.0)
- Based on geological structure (distance from faults + elevation)
- Iterative threshold adjustment to hit target buildable %
- Converges using proportional control algorithm

**Logic**:
```python
buildable_mask = (distance_to_fault > threshold_meters) | (elevation < threshold_normalized)
```

WHY OR logic: Valleys are buildable even near faults, plains are buildable even if slightly elevated

## Test Results

**Test**: tests/test_task_2.2_buildability_mask.py

✅ Binary mask generated: (1024, 1024)
✅ Buildable area: 58.3% (target: 50%, tolerance: ±10%)
✅ Mask is binary: values in {0, 1}
✅ Thresholds converged:
  - Distance: 1913m
  - Elevation: 0.15

✅ Geological consistency verified:
  - Far from faults (>500m): 74.5% buildable ✅
  - Near faults (<200m): 0.0% buildable ✅
  - Low elevation (<0.3): 78.2% buildable ✅
  - High elevation (>0.6): 0.0% buildable ✅

## Why This Avoids Gradient System Failure

**Gradient System Problem**:
- Blended 3 noise fields with different octaves (2/5/7)
- Created frequency discontinuities → 6× more jagged
- Result: 3.4% buildable (93% miss from 50% target)

**Binary Mask Solution**:
- Creates CLEAR zones (buildable vs scenic)
- Task 2.3 will use SAME octaves in both zones
- Only AMPLITUDE will differ (0.3 buildable, 1.0 scenic)
- No frequency mixing = no discontinuities

---

## Next: Task 2.3

Implement conditional noise generation:
```python
# Task 2.3: Same octaves, amplitude modulation only
base_noise = generate_perlin(octaves=6, persistence=0.5)  # SAME everywhere
amplitude_map = np.where(buildable_mask, 0.3, 1.0)
terrain = tectonic_base + (base_noise * amplitude_map)
```

This is the CORRECT approach from the original plan.

**Status**: Task 2.2 COMPLETE ✅
**Next**: Task 2.3 (Conditional Noise)
