### High Priority

- [ ] Create GUI wrapper using Tkinter
- [ ] Add preset customization save/load
- [ ] Implement undo/redo for manual edits
- [ ] Add terrain analysis tools (slope, aspect)


- [ ] Add progress indicators for long operations
- [ ] Create visual preview generation (thumbnail images)
- [ ] Implement heightmap import/modification workflow
- [ ] Add validation for height scale limits in CS2

### Map Features - Mandatory
- [ ] River network generation
- [ ] Lake/depression detection and creation
- [ ] Coastal features (beaches, cliffs)

### Quality of Life
- [ ] Command completion for interactive mode
- [ ] Map preview before export
- [ ] Comparison tool for different seeds
- [ ] Statistics visualization
- [ ] Height profile along lines

### Performance
- [ ] Multi-threading for noise generation
- [ ] Tile-based processing for memory efficiency
- [ ] Caching for repeated operations
## Enhancements
- [ ] Coordinate-based extraction
- [ ] Automatic scaling and cropping

### Advanced Generation
- [ ] Hydraulic erosion simulation
- [ ] Thermal erosion simulation
