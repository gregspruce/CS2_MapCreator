## Current System State

### What Works (Sessions 2-7 Complete)

- [x] Buildability zone generation (Session 2)
- [x] Zone-weighted terrain generation (Session 3)
- [x] Hydraulic erosion with zone modulation (Session 4)
- [x] Ridge enhancement for mountains (Session 5)
- [x] Complete pipeline integration (Session 6)
- [x] **Flow analysis and river placement (Session 7)**
- [x] D8 flow direction algorithm
- [x] Flow accumulation calculation
- [x] River path extraction
- [x] Dam site identification

### What's Not Yet Implemented

- [ ] Detail addition for steep areas (Session 8)
- [ ] Constraint verification system (Session 8)
- [ ] GUI integration (Session 9)
- [ ] Parameter presets panel (Session 10)
- [ ] User documentation (Session 10)

### Known Issues/Notes

1. **Performance**: River analysis takes ~21s at 4096x4096, which exceeds the 10s target but is acceptable. Can be optimized with more aggressive Numba JIT or GPU acceleration if needed.

2. **River detection sensitivity**: The 99th percentile threshold works well for eroded terrain but may need adjustment for different terrain types. Lower thresholds (95-98%) detect more rivers.

3. **Dam site algorithm**: Currently simplified (checks for elevation rise in 8 neighbors). Could be enhanced with perpendicular valley width analysis.

## Next Session (8) Objectives

### Detail Addition and Constraint Verification

**Objective**: Add conditional surface detail to steep areas and verify buildability constraints

**Implementation Tasks:**

1. **Conditional Detail Addition**
   - Add micro-scale detail ONLY to steep areas (slope > threshold)
   - Scale detail amplitude proportional to local slope
   - Preserve flat buildable areas (no detail where slope < 5%)
   - Use high-frequency noise (wavelength ~50-100m)

2. **Constraint Verification System**
   - Calculate actual buildable percentage accurately
   - Identify near-buildable regions (5% < slope < 10%)
   - Apply minimal smoothing if < 55% buildable
   - Document excess if > 65% buildable
   - Generate comprehensive validation report

3. **Integration with Pipeline**
   - Add as Stage 5.5 (after river analysis, before final normalization)
   - Optional detail addition (apply_detail flag)
   - Automatic constraint adjustment if needed
   - Statistics and reporting

**Deliverables:**
- `src/generation/detail_generator.py` - Conditional detail addition
- `src/generation/constraint_verifier.py` - Buildability verification
- `tests/test_detail_generator.py` - Detail addition tests
- `tests/test_constraint_verifier.py` - Verification tests
- `Claude_Handoff/SESSION_9_HANDOFF.md` - Next session guide

## Code Architecture Context

### River Network Data Structure

```python
river_network = {
    'paths': [
        {
            'points': [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ...],  # River coordinates
            'flow_accumulation': int,              # Drainage area (cells)
            'width': float,                        # River width (pixels)
            'start': (x, y),                       # Source location
            'end': (x, y),                         # Outlet location
            'length_pixels': int,                  # Path length
            'length_meters': float                 # Physical length
        },
        ...
    ],
    'flow_map': np.ndarray,              # Flow accumulation (N, N)

    'dam_sites': [                       # Potential dam locations
        {
            'location': (x, y),
            'elevation': float,
            'elevation_rise': float,
            'flow_accumulation': int
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

## Critical Parameters (Current Defaults)

### River Analysis (Session 7)
```python
river_threshold_percentile = 99.0  # Top 1% flow â†’ rivers
min_river_length = 10              # Minimum 10 pixels
```

**Tuning Guidelines:**
- Lower threshold (95-98%): More rivers detected, more tributaries
- Higher threshold (99.5-99.9%): Only major rivers, cleaner output
- Min length: Adjust based on resolution (10-50 pixels typical)

### Dam Site Detection
```python
min_flow_for_dam = resolution * resolution * 0.01  # 1% of total cells
elevation_rise_threshold = 0.05                     # 5% of height range
```

---

## Test Commands

### Run All River Analysis Tests
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_river_analysis.py -v
```

### Run Quick Tests Only (skip slow full-resolution test)
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_river_analysis.py -v -m "not slow"
```

### Run Full Pipeline with Rivers
```python
from src.generation.pipeline import TerrainGenerationPipeline

pipeline = TerrainGenerationPipeline(resolution=4096, seed=42)
terrain, stats = pipeline.generate(
    num_particles=100000,
    apply_rivers=True,
    verbose=True
)

# Access river data
river_network = stats['river_network']
river_stats = stats['river_stats']

print(f"Rivers detected: {river_stats['num_rivers']}")
print(f"Total river length: {river_stats['total_river_length_meters']:.0f}m")
```

## Integration Notes for Session 8

### Detail Addition Integration Points

1. **Input**: Use final terrain after erosion and river analysis
2. **Slope calculation**: Use slopes from BuildabilityEnforcer
3. **Conditional application**:
   ```python
   detail_amplitude = base_detail * max(0, (current_slope - 0.05) / 0.10)
   # No detail if slope < 5%, full detail if slope > 15%
   ```
4. **Output**: Modified terrain with micro-scale detail in steep areas

### Constraint Verification Integration Points

1. **Calculate buildability**: Use BuildabilityEnforcer methodology
2. **Identify problems**:
   - If < 55%: Find near-buildable regions (5-10% slope)
   - If > 65%: Document for user (reduce erosion or coverage)
3. **Auto-adjustment** (optional):
   - Apply minimal Gaussian smoothing to near-buildable regions
   - Re-validate after adjustment
4. **Report generation**: Comprehensive validation statistics

### Suggested Data Structures

```python
# Detail generator output
detail_stats = {
    'detail_applied_pct': float,      # % of terrain with detail
    'mean_detail_amplitude': float,   # Average detail height
    'max_detail_amplitude': float,    # Maximum detail height
    'processing_time': float
}

# Constraint verifier output
verification_result = {
    'final_buildable_pct': float,
    'target_min': 55.0,
    'target_max': 65.0,
    'target_achieved': bool,
    'near_buildable_pct': float,      # 5-10% slope
    'unbuildable_pct': float,         # >10% slope
    'adjustments_applied': bool,
    'adjustment_stats': dict,
    'recommendations': list
}
```

## Critical Success Factors for Session 8

1. **Detail must be conditional**: ONLY apply to steep areas, preserve flat buildable zones
2. **Performance**: Detail addition should be < 5 seconds at 4096x4096
3. **Verification accuracy**: Must use same slope calculation as BuildabilityEnforcer
4. **Auto-adjustment conservative**: Minimal smoothing, preserve terrain character
5. **Clear reporting**: User must understand if/why target not achieved
