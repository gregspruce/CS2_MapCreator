## What This Is

This directory contains a complete handoff package for evaluating the CS2 Map Generator's buildability system and determining the optimal path forward. It's designed for Claude Desktop's **deep research mode** to conduct thorough analysis and provide strategic recommendations.

## Quick Start

### For Deep Research Mode

**Start Here**: Read `HANDOFF_REPORT.md` (main entry point)

**Key Question**: Can the tectonic approach achieve 45% buildable terrain, or is 18.5% the realistic limit?

**Decision Needed**: Accept current results (18.5%) or redesign system?

## Key Research Questions

### Strategic

1. **Is the 45-55% target achievable with tectonic generation?**
   - Analyze physical constraints
   - Review industry approaches
   - Determine if fundamental limits exist

2. **Is 18% sufficient for CS2 gameplay?**
   - Research CS2 requirements
   - Analyze player expectations
   - Compare to real terrain buildability

3. **What's the optimal development path?**
   - Continue with parameter tuning (Solution D)
   - Hybrid forced flattening (Solution C)
   - Complete redesign (Solution B)

### Technical

1. **What are the physical limits?**
   - CS2 scale: 3.5m pixels, 4096m height
   - Slope calculation: Any noise creates slopes
   - Is there a theoretical maximum buildability?

2. **How do other tools handle this?**
   - World Machine approach
   - Gaea terrain generation
   - Industry best practices

3. **Can the current architecture reach 30%+?**
   - Parameter combinations not yet tried
   - Architectural modifications possible
   - Hybrid approaches viable

### Implementation

1. **Which solution path has best ROI?**
   - Time investment vs buildability gain
   - Risk of each approach
   - Maintainability long-term

2. **What would plateau-first look like?**
   - Design sketch
   - Time estimate
   - Pros/cons analysis

3. **Is there a hybrid solution?**
   - Combine tectonic realism with buildability guarantee
   - Acceptable trade-offs
   - Implementation complexity

## Solution Paths Overview

### Solution A: Accept Lower Target (2 hours)
- **What**: Change docs to 15-25% target
- **Pros**: No code changes, system complete
- **Cons**: Admit defeat on original goal
- **When**: If user testing shows 18% is acceptable

### Solution B: Plateau-First Redesign (2-3 days)
- **What**: Generate flat zones first, add mountains around
- **Pros**: Can guarantee any buildability percentage
- **Cons**: Complete redesign, may feel artificial
- **When**: If need 40%+ buildable

### Solution C: Hybrid Forced Flattening (1 day)
- **What**: Keep current system + aggressive post-flattening
- **Pros**: Combines realism with guarantees
- **Cons**: May create terraced zones
- **When**: If need 30-35% buildable

### Solution D: Extreme Parameter Sweep (2-3 hours)
- **What**: Try untested extreme combinations
- **Pros**: May find sweet spot (20-25%)
- **Cons**: Unlikely to reach 45%
- **When**: Before committing to redesign

**Recommended Order**: User Testing → Solution D → Solution C → Solution B
