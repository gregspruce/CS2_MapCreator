Test Suite for Stage 1 Quick Win 2: Ridge Continuity Enhancement

Validates that the ridge continuity enhancement:
1. Actually improves ridge connectivity (measurable difference)
2. Preserves valley structure (doesn't fill low areas)
3. Maintains proper normalization [0, 1]
4. Performs acceptably (<1s at 4096x4096)

WHY these tests matter:
- Ridge connectivity: Ensures the feature actually works
- Valley preservation: Ensures we don't create unrealistic plateaus
- Normalization: Prevents CS2 import issues
- Performance: Ensures feature doesn't bottleneck pipeline
