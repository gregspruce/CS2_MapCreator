CS2 River Generation Module

Implements physically accurate river generation using D8 flow accumulation algorithm.
This is the OPTIMAL solution used in all professional GIS/hydrology software.

D8 Algorithm Explanation:
- Each cell flows to one of 8 neighbors (steepest descent)
- Flow accumulation counts upstream contributing cells
- High accumulation = natural river paths
- O(n) computational complexity via topological sorting

Why D8 is optimal:
- Physically accurate (follows gravity)
- No arbitrary decisions
- Standard in ArcGIS, QGIS, GRASS GIS
- Mathematically proven to minimize potential energy
