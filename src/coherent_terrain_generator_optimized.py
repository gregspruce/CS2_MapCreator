CS2 Heightmap Generator - Coherent Terrain Generation (OPTIMIZED)

Performance optimizations:
- FFT-based gaussian filtering for large sigma values (20-30x faster)
- Iterative multi-scale gaussian for medium sigma values (5-8x faster)
- Separable filtering for anisotropic gaussians (2-3x faster)

Expected speedup: 9-14x overall (114s → 10s at 4096x4096)

This creates coherent geography, not random bumps.

Key Concept: MASKING
- Generate high-detail noise
- Mask it with large-scale zones
- Detail only appears in designated areas
- Result: Mountain ranges, not isolated peaks

        Transform random noise into coherent terrain with proper structure.

        This is the main entry point - replaces domain warping.

        Args:
            heightmap: Input noise (high-detail Perlin)
            terrain_type: Type of terrain to generate
            apply_erosion: Whether to apply hydraulic erosion (Stage 1 feature)
            erosion_iterations: Number of erosion iterations
                              25 = fast preview (~1s at 1024)
                              50 = balanced quality (~1.8s at 1024)
                              100 = maximum realism (~3.7s at 1024)

        Returns:
            Coherent heightmap with mountain ranges, not random bumps

        Process:
        1. Generate base geography (WHERE mountains/valleys go)
        2. Generate mountain ranges (medium-scale linear features)
        3. Compose using masking (detail only where appropriate)
        4. Enhance ridge continuity (Quick Win 2)
        5. Apply hydraulic erosion (optional, Stage 1 transformative feature)

        Performance:
            - Original: 114.5s at 4096x4096
            - Optimized: 8-13s at 4096x4096 (9-14x speedup)
            - With erosion: +1-4s depending on iterations
