Buildability Constraint System for CS2 Heightmap Generation

This module ensures generated terrain meets Cities Skylines 2's strict slope requirements.
CS2 is MUCH more slope-sensitive than CS1, requiring 45-55% of terrain at 0-5% slopes
for playable cities without extensive manual terraforming.

WHY This Module Exists:
- Random procedural terrain rarely produces enough flat buildable area
- CS2 creates "ugly terrain steps" even on gentle slopes during building placement
- Players report needing to spend hours manually flattening terrain
- Buildings (especially medium-density residential, colleges, high schools) struggle with any slope

This module implements constraint-based generation that GUARANTEES buildability targets
rather than hoping random noise produces usable terrain.

Research Foundation:
- CS2 community feedback (2023-2024)
- Real-world gradient standards (3.3% ruling, 5.0% limiting for development)
- Guérin et al. (2016) - Sparse Representation of Terrains
- Red Blob Games - Terrain from Noise (procedural generation)

    Manages buildability constraints for terrain generation.

    Ensures sufficient flat areas for Cities Skylines 2 city building while

    Key Concept:
    Instead of generating uniform terrain and hoping it's buildable,
    we create a "control map" that designates WHERE terrain should be flat
    (buildable) vs. WHERE it can be dramatic (mountains, valleys).
    Then we modulate noise generation based on this map.

        Key Insight:
        We're not generating new terrain - we're FILTERING existing terrain.
        In buildable zones, we remove high-frequency detail (smoothing).
        In unbuildable zones, we preserve all detail (keep interesting).

        Algorithm:
        1. Separate heightmap into low-frequency (octaves 1-2) and high-frequency (octaves 3+) components
        2. In buildable zones: Keep only low-frequency, remove high-frequency
        3. In unbuildable zones: Keep all frequencies
