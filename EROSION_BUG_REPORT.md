# Hydraulic Erosion Bug Report

**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: PARTIALLY FIXED - Core bugs resolved, tuning needed

## Critical Bugs Found

### Bug 1: Erosion Amplitude 1000x Too Small
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Status**: FIXED

**Root Cause**:
- Erosion simulator was designed for 8-bit heightmaps [0, 255]
- Our terrain uses float32 [0, 1] range
- This caused 255x amplitude mismatch
- Single particle erosion: 0.000003 (effectively invisible)

**Evidence**:
```
Test Results (128x128, 100 particles):
- Before fix: Max terrain change = 0.000008
- After fix: Max terrain change = 0.000515 (64x improvement)
```

**Fix Implemented**:
- Added `terrain_scale` parameter to `simulate_particle_numba()`
- Default value: 10.0 (tunable 5-50)
- Scales sediment capacity calculation
- Location: `src/generation/hydraulic_erosion.py` lines 208, 239-241

### Bug 2: Double Normalization Destroying Buildability
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Status**: FIXED

**Root Cause**:
- Erosion normalized terrain at line 446 (`hydraulic_erosion.py`)
- Pipeline normalized AGAIN at line 395 (`pipeline.py`)
- Second normalization stretched [0.020, 0.247] → [0.000, 1.000]
- This destroyed gentle slopes created by erosion
- Result: Buildability dropped from 14.4% → 0.2%

**Evidence**:
```
Pipeline Output (BEFORE FIX):
  After erosion:       14.4%
  After normalization: 0.2%    ← 72x loss!
```

**Fix Implemented**:
- Removed duplicate normalization in `pipeline.py` line 389-392
- Erosion stage now does single normalization after simulation
- Preserves gradient information between stages

### Bug 3: Buildability Calculated Before Normalization
**Severity**: HIGH
**Status**: FIXED

**Root Cause**:
- `hydraulic_erosion.py` calculated buildability BEFORE normalizing output
- Reported buildability didn't match actual output terrain
- Made debugging impossible

**Fix Implemented**:
- Moved normalization BEFORE buildability calculation
- Order now: simulate → normalize → measure buildability
- Location: `src/generation/hydraulic_erosion.py` lines 443-450

## Remaining Issues

### Issue 1: Erosion Too Aggressive (TUNING NEEDED)
**Current Behavior**:
```
Pipeline Test (512x512, 100k particles, terrain_scale=10.0):
  After terrain generation:  51.6% buildable
  After erosion:              1.1% buildable  ← WORSE!
  Expected:                  60-65% buildable
```

**Analysis**:
- Erosion is WORKING but making terrain steeper, not flatter
- Suggests particles are CARVING mountains instead of FILLING valleys
- Likely causes:
  1. `terrain_scale=10.0` still too high
  2. Erosion/deposition balance incorrect
  3. Zone modulation not working as expected

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Test with `terrain_scale=5.0` or lower
2. Increase `deposition_rate` from 0.3 to 0.5-0.7
3. Decrease `erosion_rate` from 0.5 to 0.2-0.3
4. Verify zone modulation is amplifying deposition in buildable zones

### Issue 2: Numba Cache Persistence
**Problem**: Modified `simulate_particle_numba()` signature but Numba cached old version

**Workaround**: Delete `src/generation/__pycache__` before testing

**Permanent Fix**: Add cache invalidation or version number to Numba decorator

## Files Modified

1. `src/generation/hydraulic_erosion.py`
   - Added `terrain_scale` parameter (8 locations)
   - Fixed normalization order (lines 443-450)
   - Updated docstrings

2. `src/generation/pipeline.py`
   - Removed duplicate normalization (lines 389-392)
   - Added comment explaining why

3. `test_erosion_diagnosis.py` (NEW)
   - Diagnostic test suite
   - Single particle tests
   - Multi-particle tests
   - Normalization impact tests

## Test Results Summary

### Diagnostic Test (128x128):
- ✅ Particles modify terrain (0.0005 per particle)
- ✅ Gaussian brush working (63 pixels modified)
- ✅ Normalization preserves buildability
- ❌ Buildability improvement: 0% (test terrain was uniform slope)

### Pipeline Test (512x512):
- ✅ No more double-normalization
- ✅ Erosion completes in 1.7s (fast enough)
- ❌ Buildability: 51.6% → 1.1% (REGRESSION)
- ❌ Target 55-65% not achieved

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Tune erosion parameters
   - Test `terrain_scale` values: [1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0]
   - Test erosion/deposition balance

2. **Investigation**: Why is erosion carving instead of depositing?
   - Add instrumentation to track erode vs deposit events
   - Verify sediment capacity calculation
   - Check if particles reach valleys before water evaporates

3. **Validation**: Test on real terrain
   - Use actual Session 3 output (not synthetic test terrain)
   - Verify zone modulation working correctly
   - Measure per-zone buildability changes

## Code Changes Required

All core bugs are FIXED. Remaining work is parameter tuning, not code fixes.

**Recommendation**: Test with these parameters:
```python
terrain_scale=2.0,        # Much gentler erosion
erosion_rate=0.2,         # Less carving
deposition_rate=0.7,      # More filling
evaporation_rate=0.01,    # Particles live longer
```
