# Bug Fix Session: Phase 1 GUI Integration Issues

## Bug #1: Domain Warp Type Integer-to-Enum Conversion

### Problem
GUI crashed with error: `'int' object has no attribute 'value'` when generating terrain with `domain_warp_type=0` parameter.

### Root Cause
- `heightmap_gui.py` line 570 passed `domain_warp_type=0` as an integer
- FastNoiseLite expects a `DomainWarpType` enum, not an integer
- `noise_generator.py` was missing the `DomainWarpType` import
- Direct assignment of integer to enum property caused the error

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Added Missing Import (Line 24)
```python
from pyfastnoiselite.pyfastnoiselite import FastNoiseLite, NoiseType, FractalType, DomainWarpType
```

#### 2. Added Integer-to-Enum Conversion (Lines 207-218)
```python
if domain_warp_amp > 0.0:
    noise.domain_warp_amp = domain_warp_amp
    # Convert integer to enum if needed for backward compatibility
    if isinstance(domain_warp_type, int):
        # Map integer values to DomainWarpType enum
        # 0 = OpenSimplex2, 1 = OpenSimplex2Reduced, 2 = BasicGrid
        warp_types = [
            DomainWarpType.DomainWarpType_OpenSimplex2,
            DomainWarpType.DomainWarpType_OpenSimplex2Reduced,
            DomainWarpType.DomainWarpType_BasicGrid
        ]
        noise.domain_warp_type = warp_types[domain_warp_type] if domain_warp_type < len(warp_types) else warp_types[0]
    else:
        noise.domain_warp_type = domain_warp_type
```

#### 3. Updated Documentation
Enhanced docstrings to clarify that `domain_warp_type` accepts both integers and enums.

### Testing Results

All tests passed successfully:
- Domain warp type 0 (OpenSimplex2): SUCCESS
- Domain warp type 1 (OpenSimplex2Reduced): SUCCESS
- Domain warp type 2 (BasicGrid): SUCCESS
- No domain warping (backward compatibility): SUCCESS

### Files Modified
1. `src/noise_generator.py`
   - Added `DomainWarpType` import
   - Added integer-to-enum conversion logic
   - Updated docstrings

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing code using integers (0, 1, 2) continues to work
- Code using enum values directly also works
- Default behavior (no domain warping) unchanged

## Bug #2: Missing pixel_size Parameter in analyze_slope()

### Problem
GUI crashed with error: `analyze_slope() got an unexpected keyword argument 'pixel_size'` during terrain generation.

### Root Cause
- `heightmap_gui.py` line 619 called `analyze_slope(heightmap, pixel_size=3.5)`
- `slope_analysis.py` convenience function `analyze_slope()` was missing `pixel_size` parameter
- Function signature didn't match the call from GUI

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Updated Function Signature (Line 482)
```python
def analyze_slope(heightmap: np.ndarray, pixel_size: float = 3.5, export_path: Optional[Path] = None) -> Dict:
```

#### 2. Pass pixel_size to SlopeAnalyzer (Line 498)
```python
analyzer = SlopeAnalyzer(pixel_size=pixel_size)
```

### Files Modified
1. `src/techniques/slope_analysis.py`
   - Added `pixel_size` parameter to `analyze_slope()` function signature
   - Updated function body to pass `pixel_size` to `SlopeAnalyzer` instance
   - Updated docstring to document the parameter

## Bug #3: Incorrect Slope Calculation (Heightmap Scaling)

### Problem
Slope analysis showed 100% buildable terrain (0-5% slopes) when actual terrain had 99.5% steep slopes (>45°). Buildability system completely failed to create realistic terrain constraints.

### Root Cause
- `slope_analysis.py` line 96: `np.gradient(heightmap, pixel_size)` treated normalized heightmap (0-1) as if it was already in meters
- A 0.1 normalized change (410m actual elevation) was calculated as only 0.1m elevation change
- This made all terrain appear nearly flat: 0.1m / 3.5m = 2.9% slope instead of 410m / 3.5m = 11,700% slope
- Buildability system based all decisions on these incorrect slope calculations

### The Math Error
**Wrong Calculation:**
- Gradient: 0.1 / 3.5m = 0.029 = 2.9% slope (appears buildable)

**Correct Calculation:**
- Gradient: (0.1 × 4096m) / 3.5m = 117 = 11,700% slope = 89.5° (actually steep)

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Scale Heightmap Before Gradient Calculation (Line 91)
```python
# CRITICAL: Scale normalized heightmap (0-1) to actual meters (0-4096m)
# Without this, a 0.1 normalized change is treated as 0.1m instead of 410m,
# causing all slopes to appear nearly flat (0-5% instead of actual 50-90%)
heightmap_meters = heightmap * self.CS2_DEFAULT_HEIGHT_SCALE

# Calculate gradients with proper units
gy, gx = np.gradient(heightmap_meters, self.pixel_size)
```

### Files Modified
1. `src/techniques/slope_analysis.py`
   - Added heightmap scaling by CS2_DEFAULT_HEIGHT_SCALE (4096m) before gradient calculation
   - Added detailed comment explaining the critical importance of this scaling
   - Ensures slope calculations use meters for both vertical and horizontal units
