# TODO - CS2 Heightmap Generator

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-13
**Current Version**: 2.5.0-dev
**Status**: ‚úÖ BUILDABILITY TARGET ACHIEVED - 62.7% (Target: 55-65%)

## üéØ CURRENT STATUS: TARGET ACHIEVED

### Buildability Solution - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Achievement**: 62.7% buildable terrain (target: 55-65%)

**Approach**: Zone-based generation WITHOUT erosion
- Erosion disabled by default (incompatible with float32 [0,1] terrain)
- Ridge enhancement disabled (adds steep slopes)
- Detail addition disabled (too large for gentle terrain)
- Optimized parameters: `target_coverage=0.77`, `base_amplitude=0.175`

**Test Results** (512√ó512, seed=42):
```
Buildable percentage: 62.7%  ‚úì (target: 55-65%)
Mean slope:           4.58%  ‚úì (threshold: 15%)
P90 slope:            7.74%  ‚úì (excellent)
Generation time:      0.48s  ‚úì (very fast)
```

**Documentation**:
- ‚úÖ `BUILDABILITY_SOLUTION_FINAL.md` - Complete solution guide
- ‚úÖ `EROSION_ANALYSIS_FINAL.md` - Erosion system failure analysis
- ‚úÖ `test_no_erosion_validation.py` - Validation test (passing)
- ‚úÖ `CHANGELOG.md` - Updated with comprehensive entry

## üìã IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

### 1. User Testing (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Status**: ‚è≥ Awaiting user validation

**Testing Steps**:
1. Launch GUI: `python src/main.py`
2. Generate terrain with default parameters
3. Verify buildability in 55-65% range
4. Export to CS2 and test in-game
5. Validate terrain usability for city building

**Expected Result**: Gentle, buildable terrain suitable for CS2 gameplay

---

### 2. Optional Enhancements (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Parameter Presets** (Recommended - 2-3 hours):
- Add preset configurations:
  - Balanced (default - 62.7% buildable)
  - Flatter (70-75% buildable for dense cities)
  - Moderate (55-60% buildable with more variation)
- Save/load custom presets
- Quick access dropdown in GUI

**GUI Improvements** (Nice-to-have - 2-3 hours):
- Add tooltips explaining erosion is disabled by default
- Mark erosion/ridges/detail as "experimental" in GUI
- Add warning: "Enable erosion may create vertical terrain"
- Update parameter descriptions to reflect no-erosion approach

---

## üóÇÔ∏è SYSTEM COMPONENTS STATUS

### Core Pipeline (Sessions 1-9) - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Working Components**:
- ‚úÖ Session 2: Buildability zone generation
- ‚úÖ Session 3: Zone-weighted terrain generation
- ‚úÖ Session 7: River analysis (D8 flow, river networks)
- ‚úÖ Session 8: Constraint verification

**Disabled Components** (Available but not recommended):
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Session 4: Hydraulic erosion (creates near-vertical terrain)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Session 5: Ridge enhancement (adds steep slopes)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Session 8: Detail addition (too large for gentle terrain)

**Reason for Disabling**: These components were designed for different terrain representations and create unusable steep slopes (94.90% mean, 162.84% P90) when applied to float32 [0,1] heightmaps.

## üìö DOCUMENTATION UPDATES NEEDED

### High Priority
- [ ] Update README.md with new default approach
- [ ] Update user guide (if exists) to mention erosion is disabled
- [ ] Add "Getting Started" guide for new users

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Clean up old diagnostic files (EROSION_BUG_REPORT.md, VERBOSE_BUG_FIX.md)
- [ ] Archive historical analysis documents to `/docs/historical/`
- [ ] Update ARCHITECTURE.md to reflect no-erosion approach

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add visual comparison images (with vs without erosion)
- [ ] Create parameter tuning guide for advanced users
- [ ] Document erosion redesign requirements (if future work needed)

---

## üîß POTENTIAL FUTURE WORK (OPTIONAL)

### Erosion System Redesign (8-12 hours estimated)

**If erosion is ever needed**, requires complete redesign:

1. Design algorithm specifically for float32 [0,1] terrain
2. Remove terrain_scale parameter (use relative heights)
3. Redesign gradient calculations for float precision
4. Cap erosion/deposition amounts to prevent vertical features
5. Test at each resolution (512, 1024, 2048, 4096)

**Current Status**: Documented in `EROSION_ANALYSIS_FINAL.md`, not actively planned

---

### Performance Optimizations (OPTIONAL)

**Current performance is acceptable**, but could be improved:

- [ ] Numba JIT for remaining operations (~5-20x speedup)
- [ ] Preview downsampling (generate 512√ó512 for GUI, full on export)
- [ ] GPU acceleration with CuPy (50-500x on NVIDIA hardware)
- [ ] Multi-threaded worldmap generation

---

### Quality of Life Enhancements (OPTIONAL)

- [ ] Parameter tooltips (hover text explaining each setting)
- [ ] Visual comparison tool (side-by-side before/after)
- [ ] Real-time buildability preview
- [ ] Preset management UI
- [ ] Batch generation mode
- [ ] Terrain randomization ("surprise me" button)

## üìä TESTING REQUIREMENTS (Per CLAUDE.md)

### Before Marking ANY Feature Complete

**MANDATORY Steps**:

1. **Generate Actual Output**
   ```bash
   python test_feature.py
   ```

2. **Measure Quality Metrics**
   ```python
   slopes = BuildabilityEnforcer.calculate_slopes(terrain, map_size)
   buildable_pct = BuildabilityEnforcer.calculate_buildability_percentage(slopes)
   ```

3. **Compare Against Target**
   - Buildability: Must be 55-65%
   - Mean slope: Must be <15%
   - P90 slope: Should be <20% for good terrain

4. **Visual Inspection**
   - Generate preview image
   - Check for artifacts or discontinuities
   - Compare against good examples

5. **Document Results**
   - Save test outputs
   - Record metrics
   - Update CHANGELOG.md

**NEVER** mark as complete without empirical validation.

## üóëÔ∏è COMPLETED & ARCHIVED

### ‚úÖ Buildability Investigation & Solution (2025-10-13)

**Problem**: 0.0% buildability reported by user
**Investigation**: 4 critical bugs identified
**Solution**: Zone-based generation without erosion
**Result**: 62.7% buildable terrain achieved
**Status**: COMPLETE - Production ready

See `BUILDABILITY_SOLUTION_FINAL.md` for full details.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Hydraulic Erosion System (Session 4)

**Implementation**: Complete, tested, documented
**Status**: Disabled by default
**Reason**: Incompatible with float32 [0,1] terrain
**Evidence**: Creates 94.90% mean slopes (nearly vertical)
**Availability**: Can be enabled in GUI for experimentation
**Documentation**: See `EROSION_ANALYSIS_FINAL.md`

## üìã NOTES FOR FUTURE DEVELOPERS

### Key Insights from Buildability Investigation

1. **Simpler is better**: Zone-based generation achieves target without complex post-processing
2. **Terrain scale matters**: Detail amplitude must be scaled relative to terrain range
3. **Algorithm compatibility**: Algorithms designed for 8-bit terrain don't work well with float32
4. **Test empirically**: Code inspection is not sufficient - always generate and measure

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Pure zone-based generation** is the recommended production approach
2. **Erosion remains available** for users who want to experiment
3. **Default parameters are optimized** for 55-65% buildability
4. **All pipeline stages are optional** - users can enable/disable as needed

### Development Principles (from CLAUDE.md)

1. Fix root causes, not symptoms
2. Test empirically before marking complete
3. Document honestly (failures are valuable too)
4. Follow evidence-based approaches from research
5. Maintain backward compatibility where possible
