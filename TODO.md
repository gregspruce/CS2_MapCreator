# TODO - CS2 Heightmap Generator

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-15 (Current Session)
**Current Version**: 2.5.2-dev
**Status**: ‚úÖ PRODUCTION RESOLUTION VALIDATED - 60.9% buildability at 4096√ó4096 (Target: 55-65%)

---

## üéØ CURRENT STATUS: PRODUCTION READY

### Buildability Solution - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Achievement**: 60.9% buildable terrain at **PRODUCTION RESOLUTION (4096√ó4096)** with **ALL stages enabled**

**Critical Fix This Session**: Previous 512√ó512 tests were misleading - production 4096√ó4096 had only 9.8% buildability!

**Approach**: Complete implementation per CS2_FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- ‚úÖ **Zone Generator POWER TRANSFORMATION** (push distribution toward buildable)
- ‚úÖ **Erosion Zone Modulation FIXED** (was backwards - now preserves buildable zones)
- ‚úÖ **Base Amplitude TUNED** (reduced from 0.18 to 0.09 for gentle terrain)
- ‚úÖ **3D Preview FIXED** (colorbar now shows actual elevation in meters)
- ‚úÖ **All pipeline stages enabled by default**

**Production Test Results** (4096√ó4096 with exact GUI defaults):
```
Final Buildability:   60.9%  ‚úì (target: 55-65%)
Mean Slope:           4.67%  ‚úì (threshold: 15%)
P90 Slope:            8.12%  ‚úì (excellent)
Generation time:      ~47s   ‚úì (reasonable for production)

Pipeline Progression:
- After terrain:      41.2%
- After ridges:       38.9%  (adds scenic mountains)
- After erosion:      60.9%  (fills valleys in buildable zones)
- Final:              60.9%  ‚úì

Zone Coverage:        91.1%  (target: 72%)
```

**Key Fixes Implemented This Session**:
1. **Zone Power Transformation** (zone_generator.py lines 104-134):
   - Added `potential = potential^exponent` where exponent = 0.90 - target_coverage
   - Pushes distribution toward high potential (>0.9) needed for buildability
   - Clipped to [0.08, 0.50] range for safety

2. **Erosion Zone Modulation FIXED** (hydraulic_erosion.py lines 243-283):
   - Was backwards: eroding buildable zones MORE than scenic
   - Fixed: erosion_factor = 1.5 - potential (buildable=0.5√ó, scenic=1.5√ó)
   - Added: deposition_factor = 0.5 + potential (buildable=1.5√ó, scenic=0.5√ó)
   - Result: Erosion now FILLS valleys in buildable zones (THE KEY to 55-65%)

3. **Base Amplitude Reduced** (pipeline.py line 138, parameter_panel.py line 75):
   - Changed from 0.18 to 0.09 (50% reduction)
   - Even with correct zones/erosion, 0.18 was too steep
   - Result: Gentle buildable terrain suitable for cities

4. **3D Preview Fixed** (preview_3d.py lines 25-137):
   - Colorbar was showing exaggerated values (0.0-2.0) instead of elevation
   - Fixed: Use ScalarMappable with actual elevation_range for colorbar
   - Fixed: Use actual data range (vmin/vmax) for surface color mapping
   - Result: 3D preview now shows correct elevation (0-164m) and colors

**Documentation**:
- ‚úÖ `test_production_resolution.py` - Production validation test (PASSING at 60.9%)
- ‚úÖ Zone generator updated with power transformation
- ‚úÖ Erosion modulation fixed (backwards ‚Üí correct)
- ‚úÖ Parameters tuned for production resolution
- ‚úÖ 3D preview colorbar fixed

## üìã IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

### 1. User Testing (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Status**: ‚è≥ Awaiting user validation

**Testing Steps**:
1. Launch GUI: `python src/main.py`
2. Generate terrain with ALL stages enabled (default)
3. Verify buildability in 55-65% range
4. Verify scenic features visible (ridges, valleys from erosion)
5. Export to CS2 and test in-game
6. Validate terrain usability for city building

**Expected Result**: Gentle buildable terrain with scenic mountain features suitable for CS2 gameplay

---

### 2. Documentation Cleanup (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Files to Update**:
- [ ] Update README.md with amplitude-aware scaling approach
- [ ] Archive outdated analysis files (EROSION_ANALYSIS_FINAL.md references old bugs)
- [ ] Archive BUILDABILITY_SOLUTION_FINAL.md (superseded by new solution)
- [ ] Create ARCHITECTURE.md documenting amplitude-aware pattern

**Files to Archive**:
- Move to `/docs/historical/`:
  - EROSION_ANALYSIS_FINAL.md (OLD - erosion now fixed)
  - BUILDABILITY_SOLUTION_FINAL.md (OLD - stages now enabled)
  - All diagnostic reports from initial session

---

### 3. Optional Enhancements (LOW PRIORITY)

**Parameter Presets** (Recommended - 2-3 hours):
- Add preset configurations:
  - Balanced (default - all stages, 62.1% buildable)
  - Gentle (higher buildability for dense cities)
  - Dramatic (more ridges/erosion for scenic maps)
- Save/load custom presets
- Quick access dropdown in GUI

**GUI Improvements** (Nice-to-have - 2-3 hours):
- Add tooltips explaining amplitude-aware scaling
- Add visual indicators for stage enabled/disabled
- Real-time buildability preview
- Parameter explanations in sidebar

## üí° KEY TECHNICAL INSIGHTS

### Universal Pattern: Amplitude-Aware Operations

**Key Discovery**: All terrain modifications must be scaled to terrain amplitude when working with float32 heightmaps.

**Formula Template**:
```python
terrain_amplitude = float(terrain.max() - terrain.min())
scaled_value = base_value * terrain_amplitude * multiplier
```

**Multiplier Selection Guide**:
- **1.00x**: Normalization (perfect preservation)
- **0.01x**: High-frequency features (conservative)
- **0.15x**: Low-frequency prominent features (noticeable)

**Why This Matters**:
- Float32 [0,1] terrain has 255√ó smaller numerical range than 8-bit [0,255]
- Absolute values that work for 8-bit become huge relative to float32
- Especially critical for gentle terrain [0, 0.093] used in this project

**Application Examples**:
- Erosion: Preserve amplitude during normalization (1.00x)
- Detail: Scale tiny features conservatively (0.01x)
- Ridges: Scale prominent features noticeably (0.15x)

## üîß POTENTIAL FUTURE WORK (OPTIONAL)

### Performance Optimizations

**Current performance is good**, but could be improved:

- [ ] Numba JIT for remaining operations (~5-20x speedup)
- [ ] Preview downsampling (generate 512√ó512 for GUI, full on export)
- [ ] GPU acceleration with CuPy (50-500x on NVIDIA hardware)
- [ ] Multi-threaded worldmap generation

---

### Quality of Life Enhancements

- [ ] Parameter tooltips (hover text explaining each setting)
- [ ] Visual comparison tool (side-by-side before/after)
- [ ] Real-time buildability preview
- [ ] Preset management UI
- [ ] Batch generation mode
- [ ] Terrain randomization ("surprise me" button)

---

### Advanced Features (If User Requests)

- [ ] Biome-specific terrain generation
- [ ] Coastline generation with beaches
- [ ] Plateau generation for specific gameplay
- [ ] Valley carving along specific paths
- [ ] Height-based feature placement (forests, rocks)

## üìä TESTING REQUIREMENTS (Per CLAUDE.md)

### Before Marking ANY Feature Complete

**MANDATORY Steps**:

1. **Generate Actual Output**
   ```bash
   python test_feature.py
   ```

2. **Measure Quality Metrics**
   ```python
   slopes = BuildabilityEnforcer.calculate_slopes(terrain, map_size)
   buildable_pct = BuildabilityEnforcer.calculate_buildability_percentage(slopes)
   ```

3. **Compare Against Target**
   - Buildability: Must be 55-65%
   - Mean slope: Must be <15%
   - P90 slope: Should be <20% for good terrain

4. **Visual Inspection**
   - Generate preview image
   - Check for artifacts or discontinuities
   - Compare against good examples

5. **Document Results**
   - Save test outputs
   - Record metrics
   - Update CHANGELOG.md

**NEVER** mark as complete without empirical validation.

### ‚úÖ Amplitude Amplification Bugs Fixed (2025-10-13)

   - Fix: Scale with 0.01x multiplier for high-frequency features
   - Result: Buildability maintained (62.6%)

3. **Ridges** (src/generation/ridge_enhancement.py):
   - Problem: Absolute strength (0.2) = 2.15x terrain amplitude

## üìã NOTES FOR FUTURE DEVELOPERS

### Key Insights from Buildability Investigation

1. **Amplitude-aware operations are essential** for float32 terrain
2. **Fix root causes, not symptoms** - rejected disabling stages, fixed properly
3. **Test empirically** - code inspection insufficient, always generate and measure
4. **Scale factors matter** - high-frequency (0.01x) vs low-frequency (0.15x)

### Architecture Decisions

1. **All pipeline stages enabled by default** - users get full featured terrain
2. **Amplitude-aware pattern** applied consistently across all modifications
3. **Float32 terrain requires special handling** - different from 8-bit algorithms
4. **Implementation plan fully validated** - all 6 stages working correctly

### Development Principles (from CLAUDE.md)

1. ‚úÖ Fix root causes, not symptoms
2. ‚úÖ No suboptimal fallbacks - fix properly or don't implement
3. ‚úÖ Test empirically before marking complete
4. ‚úÖ Document honestly (failures are valuable too)
5. ‚úÖ Use sequential thinking for complex problems
6. ‚úÖ Use TodoWrite for continuous progress tracking
