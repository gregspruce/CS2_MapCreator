# Changelog

All notable changes to the CS2 Heightmap Generator project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [1.4.0] - 2025-10-04

### Added - Performance Optimizations (Caching & Threading)
- **Cache Management System** (`src/cache_manager.py`)
  - LRU (Least Recently Used) caching strategy
  - Two-tier caching: memory (functools.lru_cache) + disk (pickle)
  - Configurable cache limits (default: 32 items memory, 1GB disk)
  - Cross-platform cache directory (~/.cs2_heightmaps/cache/)
  - Cache statistics and management (clear, size tracking)
  - cached_operation decorator for easy integration
  - 30,000x+ speedup on cache hits
- **Parallel Noise Generation** (`src/parallel_generator.py`)
  - Tile-based multi-threading for noise generation
  - ThreadPoolExecutor with optimal worker count (capped at 8)
  - Configurable tile size (default: 256x256, tested optimal: 128x128)
  - Progress tracking integration for parallel operations
  - Benchmark utilities for measuring speedup
  - Note: Limited speedup due to Python GIL constraints on pure Python noise libraries
- **Performance Benchmark Suite** (`test_performance.py`)
  - Multi-threading speedup validation
  - Cache effectiveness measurement
  - Memory usage profiling
  - Performance scaling tests (O(nÂ²) validation)
  - Tile size impact analysis
  - All tests passing with comprehensive metrics

### Changed
- ParallelNoiseGenerator caps workers at 8 for optimal performance
- Worker count accounts for Python GIL limitations
- Cache provides primary performance benefit (30,000x on hits)

### Technical Notes
- **Python GIL Impact**: Pure Python noise generation cannot achieve significant parallel speedup
  - perlin-noise library is pure Python (doesn't release GIL)
  - ThreadPoolExecutor limited by GIL for CPU-bound tasks
  - Single-threaded remains optimal for pure Python computation
  - ProcessPoolExecutor rejected due to pickle serialization overhead
- **Cache Strategy**: LRU chosen as optimal
  - Industry standard (used everywhere)
  - Python built-in functools.lru_cache is highly optimized
  - Perfect for preset-based workflow
  - Memory + disk tier for session persistence
- **Real Performance Gains**: Caching is the winner
  - 30,000x+ speedup on repeated operations
  - Perfect for iterative workflows
  - Preset loading benefits most
  - Memory usage remains reasonable (<100MB for 2048x2048)

### Lessons Learned
- Python threading effective for I/O, not for pure Python computation
- Caching provides far greater practical speedup than threading
- Optimal solution depends on language and library constraints
- Industry standards (LRU cache, tile-based parallelism) remain best practices
- Implementation is correct even when language limits prevent ideal speedup
