 Summary: Priority 6 Implementation Results

  I've successfully implemented and extensively tested Priority 6 enforcement. Here's what I found:

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Critical Discoveries:
  1. Smart normalization fix works - Prevents gradient amplification (MAJOR breakthrough)
  2. Priority 6 enforcement works - But has inherent limits
  3. Best result: 18.5% buildable - 5.4× better than gradient system, but far from 45-55% target
  4. Root cause: Even minimal noise creates slopes at CS2's physical scale (4096m height range)

  What I Need From You

  The 45-55% buildable target appears unachievable with the current approach. I've documented 4 possible solutions:

  A. Accept 15-25% target (pragmatic, 1-2 hours)
  - Test best parameters (18.5% buildable) in actual CS2
  - Maybe sufficient for mountainous terrain

  B. Redesign generation (radical, 2-3 days)
  - Generate flat plateaus first, add mountains around them
  - Guarantees buildability by design

  C. Hybrid approach (balanced, 1 day)
  - Keep current system + aggressive flattening post-processor
  - Forcibly flatten areas until target met

  D. More parameter testing (incremental, 2-3 hours)
  - Try ultra-extreme values (max_uplift=0.15, amp=0.01/0.15)
  - Maybe sweet spot exists

  Which path should I take? Or would you like to test the current best result (18.5% buildable) in CS2 first to see if it's acceptable?
