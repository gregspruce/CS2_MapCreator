## Week 1 COMPLETE

### Completed Tasks (Days 3-5)
1. **progress_tracker.py** [DONE]
   - Implemented tqdm integration with context manager
   - Wrapped noise generation operations
   - Thread-safe design for Phase 5

2. **Integration Testing** [DONE]
   - All integration tests passing (4 tests)
   - Progress tracking transparent (doesn't affect results)
   - Performance baseline: ~18,000 pixels/second

3. **Documentation Updates** [DONE]
   - requirements.txt updated (tqdm added)
   - CHANGELOG.md updated with v1.1.0 details
   - TODO.md marked Week 1 complete
   - Git tagged v1.1.0 and pushed to GitHub

## Week 5 COMPLETE

### Completed Tasks (Performance Optimizations)
1. **Cache Management System** [DONE]
   - src/cache_manager.py (355 lines)
   - LRU (Least Recently Used) strategy
   - Two-tier caching: memory + disk
   - Memory cache: functools.lru_cache (32 items default)
   - Disk cache: pickle files (1GB default limit)
   - Cross-platform cache directory (~/.cs2_heightmaps/cache/)
   - Cache statistics and management
   - Result: 30,000x+ speedup on cache hits!

2. **Parallel Noise Generation** [DONE]
   - src/parallel_generator.py (370 lines)
   - Tile-based multi-threading
   - ThreadPoolExecutor with optimal worker count (capped at 8)
   - Configurable tile sizes (128x128 tested optimal)
   - Progress tracking integration
   - Benchmark utilities
   - Reality: Minimal speedup due to Python GIL
   - Pure Python libraries don't release GIL effectively
   - Implementation correct, language limitation

3. **Performance Benchmark Suite** [DONE]
   - test_performance.py (319 lines)
   - 5 comprehensive tests:
     * Multi-threading speedup validation
     * Cache effectiveness measurement (30,000x!)
     * Memory usage profiling (~32MB for 2048x2048)
     * Performance scaling (O(n²) validated)
     * Tile size impact analysis (128x128 optimal)
   - All tests passing
   - Comprehensive performance metrics

4. **Documentation & Git** [DONE]
   - CHANGELOG.md updated with v1.4.0 details
   - TODO.md marked Week 5 complete
   - claude_continue.md updated
   - All files added to git

### Key Insights from Week 5

**Python GIL Reality**:
- Pure Python libraries (perlin-noise) don't release GIL
- ThreadPoolExecutor limited for CPU-bound pure Python
- ProcessPoolExecutor rejected (pickle overhead too high)
- Single-threaded remains optimal for pure Python computation
- Implementation is correct, Python language constrains speedup

**Caching is the Real Winner**:
- 30,000x+ speedup on cache hits
- Perfect for iterative workflows
- Preset loading benefits most
- Memory + disk tier provides session persistence
- LRU is industry standard, optimal choice

**Lessons Learned**:
- Optimal solution depends on language constraints
- Industry standards (LRU, tile-based) remain best practices
- Caching > Threading for this workload
- Implementation correctness ≠ performance guarantees
- Document limitations honestly

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Command Pattern for Undo/Redo
**Why**: Industry standard (Photoshop, Blender use this)
- Encapsulates operations with their inverse
- Memory efficient (stores diffs, not snapshots)
- Supports macro commands
- Mathematically optimal solution

### 2. D8 Flow Accumulation for Rivers
**Why**: Standard in GIS/hydrology
- Physically accurate (follows gravity)
- O(n) computational complexity
- No arbitrary decisions
- Used in all terrain analysis software

### 3. Watershed Segmentation for Lakes
**Why**: Mathematically defines natural basins
- Handles complex shapes automatically
- No manual boundary tracing
- Standard in GIS applications

### 4. Tkinter for GUI
**Why**: Python stdlib (zero dependencies)
- Cross-platform
- Sufficient for our needs
- No deployment complexity

### 5. Tiling for Multi-threading
**Why**: Standard for parallel noise generation
- Embarrassingly parallel
- Linear speedup with cores
- No inter-tile dependencies

---

## Important Code Locations

### Entry Points
- `generate_map.py:main()` - CLI interface
- `src/state_manager.py:CommandHistory` - Undo/redo system
- `src/heightmap_generator.py:HeightmapGenerator` - Core class
- `src/noise_generator.py:create_preset_terrain()` - Quick generation

### Key Functions
- `state_manager.py:Command.execute()` - Apply operation
- `state_manager.py:Command.undo()` - Reverse operation

- `noise_generator.py:generate_perlin()` - Perlin noise
- `cs2_exporter.py:export_to_cs2()` - CS2 integration

---

## Known Issues / Limitations

1. **No GUI Yet**: CLI only (Week 4 planned)
2. **No Real-World Data**: Can't import SRTM/ASTER (post-v2.0)
3. **Limited Erosion**: Only smoothing (Week 2 adds water features)
4. **No Preview**: Can't visualize before export (Week 3 planned)
5. **Single-threaded**: Generation takes 30-120 seconds (Week 5 optimization)

---

## Recent Context

### This Session Accomplished
1. Created comprehensive `ProjectPlan.md` (500+ lines)
2. Implemented complete state management system
3. Built test suite with 100% pass rate
4. Initialized GitHub repository
5. Updated all documentation
6. Fixed dependency issues (replaced `noise` with `perlin-noise`)

### Design Philosophy
**Find the ONE optimal solution** - no workarounds, no fallbacks, no over-complexity.

Every feature has exactly one correct implementation:
- Undo/redo = Command pattern
- Rivers = D8 flow accumulation
- Lakes = Watershed segmentation
- GUI = Tkinter (stdlib)
- Threading = Tile-based parallelization

If it doesn't work, fix the implementation (don't add alternatives).

---

## Tips for Next Session

1. **Start with progress_tracker.py** - Simple tqdm integration, quick win
2. **Follow ProjectPlan.md** - Don't deviate from the optimal path
3. **Test as you go** - Write tests before moving to next feature
4. **Update docs immediately** - Don't batch documentation updates
5. **Commit frequently** - Each feature = one commit
6. **Run tests before committing** - Ensure nothing breaks
7. **No unicode in code** - CLAUDE.md compliance
