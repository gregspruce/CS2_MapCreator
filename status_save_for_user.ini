now please: ultrathink, use relevant subagents, use context7, strictly follow claude.md guidance, make sure all relevant documentation is updated as you go,  and continue per the project plan. esnure all 
improvements are properly implemented and used in the gui. check generation after each implementation for functionality. generate sample map and analyze to ensure enhancements are producing expected results\
\
find and address the root cause of the following problem: buildability is failing. generated terrain is still extremely locally noisy (artifact from initial noise seed? from upscaling the downsampled data used for       
processing?)\
\
you need to generate sample terrains, examine the results and logs and determine if the pipeline is functioning to create the desired results
